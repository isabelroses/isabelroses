### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Isabel

I am currently studying computer science, as a second year student at Aberystwyth University. My main interests are in the terminal shown by my obsession with nix. Furthermore I am currently learning the programming language golang.
What do I do with some of my spare time? Well I contribute to a awesome project [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).

P.S. Never ask me what's on my todo list, it's up to [@comfysage](https://github.com/comfysage)
