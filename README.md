### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Isabel

I am currently studying computer science, as a third year student at Aberystwyth University. 
A significant amount of my time goes into being a [Nixpkgs committer](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/nixpkgs-committers.md#nixpkgs-committers"),
where I help maintain the Nixpkgs repository.

P.S. Never ask me what's on my todo list, it's up to [@comfysage](https://github.com/comfysage)
